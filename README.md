# Qubit by Qubit Quantum Computing Course

This repository consists notebooks and other code files I created as assignments for Qubit by Qubit course and consider relevant for educational purposes to other people who might be interested in quantum computing. This repository will be continuously updated until April 2023. Furthermore I want to make this more accessible, which is why I am thinking about tools to use and will work on this soon.

In this course I work with IBM Quantum Experience to run the jupyter notebooks on a quantum computer.
Since the imported Qiskit libraries are very heavy a normal jupyter notebook exceeds 25 MB which is why I upload them compressed. I'll handle this soon.

I recommend to get registered at IBM Quantum Experience and use their Quantum Lab. It's quite intuitive and all necessary packages are already important whenever you open a new Python3 file.

// TO DO: check Papermill for workflow automation with jupyter notebooks (https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-papermill-2c61f66bea30)
Add Lab_Week6 and Lab_Week7 to repo
