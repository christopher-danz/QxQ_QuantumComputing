# Qubit by Qubit Quantum Computing Course

## Introduction 

This repository consists jupyter notebooks and other code files I created as assignments for Qubit by Qubit course on Quantum Computing. Currently I consider the content of these files as interesting to me and maybe to others who might be beginners in quantum computing too. This repository will be continuously updated until April 2023 when the course ends.

Besides updating this repoistory with the latest assignments I did in class, I am trying to make this repository more accessible and work on that.
... write some more about my motivation and importance of diversity in advanced technologies ... 

In this course I work with IBM Quantum Experience to run the jupyter notebooks on a quantum computer.
Since the imported Qiskit libraries are very heavy a normal jupyter notebook exceeds 25 MB which is why I upload them compressed. I'll handle this soon.

I recommend to get registered at IBM Quantum Experience and use their Quantum Lab. It's quite intuitive and all necessary packages are already important whenever you open a new Python3 file.

// TO DO: check Papermill for workflow automation with jupyter notebooks (https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-papermill-2c61f66bea30)
Add Lab_Week6 and Lab_Week7 to repo

2. Configuring our development environment
2.1 Installing Papermill and JupyterLab
We are going to start by creating a development environment using Conda (1, 2) and installing JupyterLab and other libraries used on the analysis (3).
