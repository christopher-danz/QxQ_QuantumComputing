# QxQ_QuantumComputing
This repository consists of notebooks I created as assignments for Qubit by Qubit course and consider relevant for educational purposes to other people who might be interested in quantum computing. 

In this course I work with IBM Quantum Experience to run the jupyter notebooks on a quantum computer.
Since the imported Qiskit libraries are very heavy a normal jupyter notebook exceeds 25 MB which is why I upload them compressed.
